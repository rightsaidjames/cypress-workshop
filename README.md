# Cypress Workshop
A brief Cypress workshop, introducing test organisation principles and key Cypress commands

## Setup

Ensure that you have Node installed on your system using the following Terminal command:
```
node -v
```

If not, you can download and install the LTS version from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

If your current version of Node is quite old, you can install the current LTS version using the link above. If you installed it using Homebrew, you can upgrade it using the command `brew upgrade node`.

Next, clone this repository, navigate to its root directory, then install Cypress and its dependencies:
```
git clone git@github.com:rightsaidjames/cypress-workshop.git
cd cypress-workshop
npm install
```

To open Cypress, run:
```
npx cypress open
```

Then open the `cypress-workshop` directory in a code editor such as VS Code or Atom.
